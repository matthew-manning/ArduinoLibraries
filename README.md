# ArduinoLibraries

Library written for Arduino Uno, should work for all types, but check first.
Handles setup of pins as keys. Generates pressed and relased events into buffers when the pollKeys() is called.

Anyone is welcome to reuse this code for non-profit/non-comerical perposes, so long as original credit is given.
